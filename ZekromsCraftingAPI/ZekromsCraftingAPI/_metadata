Otherwise, it is no use to you.\n\nQ: Can I use this in my mod?\nA: Yes, as long as you mention that this mod is required (As extended crafting will not work)\n\nQ: Do I need to use `\"require\"` or `\"includes\"` to have this mod work?\nA: This mod works after initialization is done so, no `\"require\"` or `\"includes\"` is not necisary (I think)\n\nQ: Can I use your code?\nA: It depends, what are you using it for?  (You can use the .lua functions that are listed below **AND** include my mod as a required mod)\n\nQ: I found an issue, where do I report it?\nA: Go to the github issues section and post it there **if it is not already there!**  Also, include your starbound log **and** the mod(s) you are using and that use this mod.\n\nQ: Can I distribute this mod?\nA: No, just link to this page or the github page",
